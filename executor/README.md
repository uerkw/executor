# Executor Monorepo

Executor is now Convex-native.

## What is here

- `convex/`: executor control plane, MCP HTTP endpoint, task execution/actions, policies, credentials, approvals, and persistence.
- `convex/lib/`: runtime, MCP server helpers, typechecker, tool loading/discovery utilities.
- `apps/web`: executor web UI for approvals, task history, and settings.
- `packages/contracts`: shared task/tool/policy contract types.

## Run

```bash
bun install
```

Terminal 1:

```bash
bun run dev:convex
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
bun run dev:web
```

Optional Terminal 3 (stateful MCP gateway for elicitation/sampling over Streamable HTTP):

```bash
bun run dev:mcp-gateway
```

## Tests

```bash
bun test convex/database.test.ts convex/executor-mcp.e2e.test.ts
```

## Notes

- MCP endpoint is served by Convex HTTP routes at `/mcp`.
- For a long-lived stateful MCP transport (recommended for elicitation in multi-worker environments), run the gateway at `http://localhost:3003/mcp`.
- Local gateway auth is optional by default; set `MCP_GATEWAY_REQUIRE_AUTH=1` to enforce MCP OAuth on the gateway.
- Set `MCP_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER` (or `MCP_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_URL`) to enable MCP OAuth bearer-token verification.
- When MCP OAuth is enabled, the server exposes `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and proxies `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.
- Internal runtime callback routes are served by Convex HTTP routes at `/internal/runs/:runId/*`.
- `run_code` supports TypeScript typechecking and runtime transpilation before execution.
- `run_code` now attempts MCP form elicitation for pending tool approvals when the MCP client advertises `elicitation.form`; clients without elicitation support continue using the existing out-of-band approval flow.

## Credential Providers

`sourceCredentials` now supports pluggable providers:

- `managed` (default): stores `secretJson` in Convex.
- `workos-vault`: stores credential payload in encrypted external storage and keeps only a reference in Convex.

`workos-vault` uses the standard `WORKOS_API_KEY` environment variable for Vault reads.

Examples for `upsertCredential.secretJson`:

- `managed`: `{ "token": "ghp_..." }`
- `workos-vault`: `{ "token": "ghp_..." }` (backend stores encrypted object)

Compatibility note: `workos-vault` also accepts `{ "objectId": "secret_..." }` when importing existing references.
