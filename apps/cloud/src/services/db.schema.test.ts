// Regression: every cloud drizzle instance must be constructed with the
// merge of cloud + executor schemas. If ANY call site builds its own
// `{ schema }` without spreading both, `db._.fullSchema` comes back
// missing tables and the drizzle adapter throws
// `unknown model "source"` at the first request that touches scoped data.
//
// We hit this in prod (MCP endpoint) when `mcp-session.ts` built
// `combinedSchema = { ...cloudSchema }` and forgot to spread the executor
// schema — web-app requests worked because they went through
// `DbService.Live`, but the MCP Durable Object constructed its own.
//
// This test asserts the only sanctioned constant (`combinedSchema` from
// `./db`) actually contains every executor-schema export AND that drizzle
// surfaces them all under `db._.fullSchema`.
