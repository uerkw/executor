This package contains code vendored from better-auth
(https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth), originally authored by
Bereket Engida and contributors, licensed under MIT.

Modifications were made to remove authentication-specific types and to
adapt the interfaces to the executor project.

Vendored files:
  - src/adapter.ts — ported from packages/core/src/db/adapter/index.ts
    and types.ts (DBAdapter interface, Where DSL, CustomAdapter,
    DBAdapterFactoryConfig). Promise → Effect conversion, auth-specific
    model names stripped.
  - src/schema.ts — ported from packages/core/src/db/type.ts
    (DBSchema, DBFieldAttribute, InferDB*).
  - src/factory.ts — ported from packages/core/src/db/adapter/factory.ts
    (createAdapterFactory). Promise → Effect. Stripped auth-specific
    concerns: BetterAuthOptions generic, numeric serial ids, joins,
    telemetry spans, logger, plural model resolution. Matches our
    simpler CustomAdapter + DBAdapterFactoryConfig shape.
  - src/testing/memory.ts — ported from
    packages/memory-adapter/src/memory-adapter.ts (memoryAdapter).
    Promise → Effect. Piped through our createAdapter.
  - storage-drizzle/src/adapter.ts — ported from
    packages/drizzle-adapter/src/drizzle-adapter.ts (drizzleAdapter).
    Promise → Effect. Takes an explicit tables map instead of reading
    db._.fullSchema. Piped through our createAdapter.
