// Regression for the hang reported as the executor-MCP "180s timeout" against
// Cowork (Claude web). Cowork goes down the `executeWithPause` branch because
// it doesn't advertise managed elicitation. When the dynamic worker fails
// fast (e.g. user submits TS with a `:` type annotation, "Unexpected token
// ':'" inside ~25ms), the failure was swallowed and the request hung until
// the client gave up at 180s. The cause was `Effect.race` having
// prefer-success semantics in Effect v4: the racing pause-signal Deferred
// never resolves, so a fiber failure is never observed by the racer.
