/**
 * Canonical reactivity keys for query/mutation invalidation.
 *
 * effect-atom's `Reactivity` service refreshes any query whose `reactivityKeys`
 * overlap with a completed mutation's `reactivityKeys`. The Reactivity instance
 * is shared across the global Atom registry, so keys interop across plugin
 * clients (`McpClient`, `OpenApiClient`, `ExecutorApiClient`, …).
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - Every query that reads a server resource sets `reactivityKeys` at the
 *     query atom's definition site.
 *   - Every mutation passes `reactivityKeys` at the call site (mutations don't
 *     accept the option at definition time — see effect-atom AtomHttpApi).
 *   - Use the constants below; do not invent ad-hoc string keys at call sites.
 *
 * Per-scope precision is intentionally dropped: a mutation in one scope
 * invalidating another scope's queries is harmless (users see one scope at a
 * time) and keeps the convention ergonomic.
